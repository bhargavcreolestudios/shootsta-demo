**intro**
```
there are two directories listed. one is for
node server where we are going to upload a video.
our server side API logic is also listed there.

the second directory is where our react project stored.
```
**Steps**
1) go to `node-js` directory and install dependancies `npm install / yarn install`
2) install dependancies in `react-js` directory by doing same.
3) our main server node file is `server.js` to start, open the console and start running server by `node server.js`. console will gives you an output something like `"Working on port 8000 :)`. now your server is started. it is running on port 8000.
4) now to start react project, go to `react-js` directory and start the engine `npm start`. it will run on port `3000`.
5) the first page is home page where our uploaded videos will be listed. 
6) you can see a `view` button label there. it will take you to streaming page where you can watch a video.
7) to upload a video. go to upload tab.
