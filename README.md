There are two directories available. one is for node server (backend) where we are going to upload a video.
our server side API logic is also listed there.

The second directory is where our react project available.
```
**Steps**
1) Go to `node-js` directory and install dependancies `npm install / yarn install`
2) Install dependancies in `react-js` directory by doing same.
3) our main server node file is `server.js` which is in `node-js` directory. to start, go to `node-js` direactory, open the console and run server by `node server.js`. console will gives you an output something like `"Working on port 8000 :)`. now your server is started. it is running on port 8000.
4)  To start react project, go to `react-js` directory and start the engine `npm start`. it will run on port `3000`.
5) The first page is home page where our uploaded videos will be listed. 
6) You can see a `view` button label there. it will take you to streaming page where you can watch a video.
7) To upload a video. go to upload tab.
